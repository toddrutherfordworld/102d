# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

##prompt
The fist one is called prompt. It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt() function. Then, in this example we use the document.write method to update the html with the text.

examples/js/prompt.html

<script>
 
var name = prompt("Your name:", "");
document.write("Hello ", name);
 
</script>

#alert
This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text. (You can click on Try! that will open the specific script in a separate window.) The alert() function is actually rarely used, but it is an easy way to show the use of JavaScript.

examples/js/alert.html

<script language="javascript">
 
alert("Hello World");
 
</script>
 
#Try!
If you'd like to try it yourself, open your editor and create a file with .html extension (for example hello.html) and put the above code in the file. Then switch to your browser and open the file with the browser. (Most browsers will let you do that using the File/Open File menu option.)

document.write
examples/js/document_write.html

First line
<script>
 
document.write("<h1>Hello World</h1>");
 
</script>
Last line

## Things I want to know more about

I would love to learn more about the backend container solutions of node.js and sqllite or myspl and NoSQL databases. I would love to know how to develop a full stack javascript application that is interactive. 

I would also like to learn React and React Native.
